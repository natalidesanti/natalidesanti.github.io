Hello, I am [**Natalí de Santi**](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3869697280207128), a physicist interested in cosmology (specially in the large scale structure of 
the Universe, dark matter, dark energy, cosmological covariance matrices, parameter inference, N-body and hydrodynamical simulations, and halo-galaxy 
connection), data science, machine learning and programming. Currently, I am at the Flatiron Institute, Simons Foundation working with 
[Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro](https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/), and I am a PhD candidate in the Institute of Physics, at University of São Paulo
(USP), working with [Raul Abramo](http://www.fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/Home.html).

First things first, a little **about me**:

Since I was a child I am fascinated by science, mostly Astronomy and Physics, and computers (as you can see in the below pic I was only 4 years old and I had strange abilities to draw cute ducks in Paint).

This passion led me to participate in [olympiads on Astronomy](http://www.oba.org.br/site/) since I was young. During high school I had the opportunity to 
develop a work of experimental pre-scientific initiation in superconductivity, with [Hernandes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2019448857205643), at USP of São
Carlos. This opportunity was the trigger for me to decide to study Physics instead of Astronomy, and I was able to graduate at USP, in my hometown. 
At the beginning of the course I continued with an experimental scientific initiation in material physics in the same research group (the old 
[CCMC](https://cdmf.org.br/)). My interest in computation and theoretical physics led me to my second scientific initiation, in Particle Physics, with 
[Attilio Cucchieri](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5661661960969099). After graduation, I changed university, to do my master's degree on the other side of the 
city, at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), working with [Raphael Santarelli](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3591899759824320). I was able to study 
General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime, doing a 
[review on Hawking radiation](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-11172019000300421&tlng=pt) and discussing the 
[temporal evolution of Schwarzchild's black hole mass](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13538-019-00708-y), considering this effect. 

Today, in my PhD, I have the privilege of being able to adventure in Cosmology, now at USP of São Paulo, capital. General speaking my current research line 
is applying machine learning methods to tackle Cosmology problems, more specifically: I have been working trying to improve cosmological covariance 
matrices from [ExSHalos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06630) and [Quijote simulations](https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), using image 
denoising techniques (see more details in my [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10881)); doing the bridge of the halo--galaxy connection for central 
galaxies (you can check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06054)); obtaining cosmological parameters for 
[CAMELS suite](https://camels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). This new journey is being wonderful and, for the first time in my life I am outside Brazil!

**This page**:

In this page I want to share a little about the fantastic world of my research topic (and correlated ones) and my work until now. So, you could see since
how to simulate the Universe on a computer to machine learning techniques.
