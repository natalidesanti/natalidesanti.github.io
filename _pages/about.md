Hello there 👋! 

My name is [**Natalí de Santi**](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3869697280207128). 
I am a physicist working with statistical, computational and machine learning (ML) methods applied to Cosmology and Astrophysics. 
I am currently a Postdoctoral Scholar at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics ([BCCP](https://bccp.berkeley.edu)), University of California, Berkeley ([UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu)), and an affiliated researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ([LBL](https://www.lbl.gov)). 
My main interests in these topics are related to:
* large scale structure of the Universe,
* dark matter and dark energy,
* cosmological parameter inference,
* N-body and hydrodynamical simulations,
* halo-galaxy connection,
* BAO reconstruction and parameter estimation

More than just Physics, I am deeply curious about a bunch of methods in data science, machine learning and programming.

I became a doctor by [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br), under the supervision of [Dr. Luis Raul Weber Abramo](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4558796258762790) ([USP](https://www5.usp.br)) and [Dr. Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro](https://franciscovillaescusa.github.io/) ([Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/)).
If you wanna take a look at my thesis, where I discuss about how to use machine learning methods for extracting cosmological information, you can find it [here](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/43/43134/tde-15072024-101341/publico/tesenatalisolermatubarodesanti.pdf).

First things first, a little **about me**:

Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by science, particularly Astronomy and Physics, as well as by computers. 
As you can see in the picture below, when I was only 4 years old, I had a strange ability to draw cute ducks in Paint.

This passion led me to participate in [Astronomy Olympiads](http://www.oba.org.br/site/) from a young age. 
During high school, I had the opportunity to engage in experimental highscholl research to work on superconductivity with [Dr. Antonio Carlos Hernandes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2019448857205643) at [USP, in São Carlos](https://saocarlos.usp.br/welcome-to-usp-sao-carlos/). 
This opportunity served as the catalyst for me to choose to study Physics over Astronomy. 

I completed my undergraduate degree at [USP in my hometown](https://saocarlos.usp.br/welcome-to-usp-sao-carlos/), in the Institute of Physics of São Carlos ([IFSC](https://www2.ifsc.usp.br/english/)).
At the beginning of my undergraduate course, I continued with experimental undergrad research in material physics within the same research group (the former [CCMC](https://cdmf.org.br/)). 
My interest in computation and theoretical physics eventually led me to my second undergrad research project, focusing on Particle Physics, under the guidance of [Dr. Attilio Cucchieri](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5661661960969099).

After completing my undergraduate degree, I changed universities to pursue my master's degree at the [Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar)](https://www.ufscar.br), working under the supervision of [Dr. Raphael Santarelli](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3591899759824320). 
During this period, I had the opportunity to delve into General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetime. 
My research included a [review of Hawking radiation](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-11172019000300421&tlng=pt) and discussions on the [temporal evolution of a Schwarzschild black hole's mass](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13538-019-00708-y), taking this effect into account.

During my PhD studies, I had the privilege of delving into the field of Cosmology, now at the [University of São Paulo, in the capital city](https://www5.usp.br). 
More than that, I had the opportunity to work as a guest researcher and a [CCA predoc](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron-institute-center-for-computational-astrophysics-pre-doctoral-program) at the Flatiron Institute, during September 2022 to August 2023, going abroad for the first time in my life.

Broadly speaking, starting from the research I started during my PhD, my current research focuses on applying statistical, computational and ML methods to address problems in Cosmology and Astrophysics.

Specifically, my work includes:

1) **Field-level Simulation-based Inference for Cosmology**
* Everything stated when we figured out that a Graph Neural Network (GNN) combined with a Moment Neural Network (MNN) - to extract information from smaller scales than ever before. More details about this work can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14101). This model has proven to be robust against five different sub-grid physical models, various halo/subhalo finders, and changes in cosmological and astrophysical parameters, including those not encountered during the training phase.
* However, observations are influenced by various effects, including (i) masking, (ii) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and (iii) different galaxy selection criteria. We are now demonstrating that GNNs can be used to overcome these challenges as well are available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15234)).
* Also, I contributed with works on [Symbolic Regression to explain the GNNs applied to halos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14591), being able to show equations to actually translate what the GNNs are doing and the reason behind the success of [Astrid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02096), as the best hydrodynamic simulation to obtain a robust ML model, having a broader variations to the galaxy properties as well we their wide number of galaxy per galaxy catalog.
* Recently, we have been able to show that the semi-analytic models (SAMs) are really well compared to the expensive hydrodynamical simulations, using GNNs combined with both MNN or Normalizing Flows (NF). You can find more details [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10222).

3) I have been working on improving cosmological covariance matrices using data from [ExSHalos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06630) and [Quijote simulations](https://quijote-simulations.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) by employing image denoising techniques. Further information can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10881)).
  
6) I'm also involved in bridging the connection between halos and galaxies, specifically for central galaxies. Particularly, I am interested in recovering the scatter intricate relations of this connection. You can learn more about this research in our [first](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06054), [second](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06398), and [third](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17844) works.

This journey has been wonderful so far!

In this page I want to share a little about the fantastic world of my research topic (and correlated ones) and my work so far. 
You will see since on how to simulate the Universe on a computer to machine learning techniques.
