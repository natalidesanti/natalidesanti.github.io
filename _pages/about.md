Hello, I am [**Natalí de Santi**](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3869697280207128), a physicist interested in cosmology, data science, machine learning and programming. Currently, I am a PhD candidate of Institute of Physics at University of São Paulo (USP), working with Professor [Raul Abramo](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4558796258762790) (and he has a pretty nice [webpage](http://www.fma.if.usp.br/~abramo/Home.html), check it out!).

First things first, a little **about me**:

Since I was a child I am fascinated by science, mostly Astronomy and Physics, and computers (as you can see in the below pic I was only 4 years old and I have strong abilities to draw cute ducks in Paint).

This passion led me to participate in [olympiads on Astronomy](http://www.oba.org.br/site/) since I was young. During high school I had the opportunity to develop a work of experimental pre-scientific initiation in superconductivity, with Professor [Hernandes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2019448857205643), at USP of São Carlos. This opportunity was the trigger for me to decide to study Physics instead of Astronomy, and I was able to graduate from USP in my hometown. At the beginning of the course I continued with an experimental scientific initiation in material physics in the same research group (the old [CCMC](https://cdmf.org.br/)). My interest in computation and theoretical physics led me to my second scientific initiation, in Particle Physics, with Professor [Attilio Cucchieri](http://lattes.cnpq.br/5661661960969099). After graduation, I changed university, to do my master's degree on the other side of the city, at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar), working with Professor [Raphael Santarelli](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3591899759824320). I was able to study General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory in Curved Spacetimes, doing a [review on Hawking radiation](http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1806-11172019000300421&tlng=pt) and discussing the [temporal evolution of Schwarzchild's black hole mass](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13538-019-00708-y), considering this effect. Today, at the doctorate, I have the privilege of being able to adventure in Cosmology, now at USP of São Paulo, capital. The focus of my current research are the cosmological covariance matrices and machine learning methods applied to Cosmology. This new journey is being wonderful!

**This page**:

In this page I want to share a little about the fantastic world of my research topic (and correlated ones) and my work until now. So, you could see since how to simulate the Universe on a computer to machine learning techniques.
