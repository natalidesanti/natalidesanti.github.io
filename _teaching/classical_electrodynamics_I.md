I helped graduated physics students with problems, concepts and theory related to Classical Electrodynamics I. Besides, together with the professor, we 
proposed the problem sets and I solved and made available the solution of them to the students.

The course was given by Professor Luis Raul Weber Abramo. The page for these lectures was [https://edisciplinas.usp.br/course/view.php?id=85302](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/course/view.php?id=85302).
