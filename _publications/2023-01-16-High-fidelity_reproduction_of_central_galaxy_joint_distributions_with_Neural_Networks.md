Paper highlights:
- Uses neural networks to predict full probability distributions of central galaxy properties from dark matter halo features in the IllustrisTNG300 simulation.
- Captures the intrinsic scatter in the halo–galaxy connection, enabling uncertainty quantification and detailed modeling of distinct galaxy populations.
- Accurately reproduces galaxy clustering statistics, outperforming traditional single-point estimators.
