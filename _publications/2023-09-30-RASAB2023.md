Paper highlights:
-	Introduces a machine learning approach to denoise cosmological covariance matrices estimated from as few as 50 power spectra.
- Trains convolutional neural networks on inexpensive mock simulations to produce covariances nearly indistinguishable from those built using thousands of spectra.
- Shows that denoised covariances recover cosmological parameters with accuracy comparable to analyses based on much larger simulation sets.
