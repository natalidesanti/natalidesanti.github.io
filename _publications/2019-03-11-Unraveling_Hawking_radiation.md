**Abstract:**

In the classical theory of general relativity black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is
shown that quantum mechanical eﬀects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with
temperature proportional to $\kappa$, the surface gravity of the black hole. This paper has the main goal to unraveling
Hawking radiation, for spherically symmetric collapse, serving as motivation and support to introductory studies
in quantum field theory in curved space-times.
