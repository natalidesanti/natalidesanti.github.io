Paper highlights:
-	Introduces CAMELS-ASTRID, a new suite of 2,124 hydrodynamical simulations extending the CAMELS project with broader coverage of cosmological and feedback parameters.
- Shows that ASTRID features milder AGN feedback and a wider diversity of galaxy populations, enabling machine-learning models with improved extrapolation across different hydrodynamical simulations.
- Demonstrates that training on highly diverse galaxy-formation models is key for robust ML-based cosmological inference, including accurate parameter recovery from high-dimensional simulation sets
