Paper highlights:
- Uses several ML algorithms to learn how galaxy properties depend on their host dark matter haloes.
- Shows that combining models and augmenting data improves predictions for rare galaxy populations.
- Finds that stellar mass is tightly linked to haloes, while other properties require additional physics.
