Paper highlights:
- __Cosmology is encoded in individual galaxies:__ we show that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ can be inferred directly from intrinsic galaxy properties, without relying on traditional clustering or lensing statistics. This challenges the standard separation between galaxy formation and cosmological inference.
- __A simple, interpretable analytic tracer for $\Omega_m$:__ using symbolic regression on CAMELS simulations (including IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, Astrid, and Swift-EAGLE), we derive a compact functional form that robustly recovers $\Omega_m$ across simulation suites with only minor recalibration.
- __A physical explanation: baryonic retention encodes $\Omega_m$:__ The tracer admits a clear interpretation, gravitational potential depth regulates baryonic retention and enrichment efficiency, naturally imprinting $\Omega_m$ into galaxy-scale observables.

This builds a direct, interpretable bridge between small-scale galaxy physics and large-scale cosmology.
