**Abstract:**

In the classical theory of general relativity black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. When quantum mechanical
effects are taken into account, then the black holes emit particles as hot bodies with temperature proportional to $\kappa$, 
its surface gravity. This thermal emission can lead to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole, and eventually to its 
disappearance, also called black hole evaporation. This characteristic allows us to analyze what happens with the mass of the 
black hole when its temperature is increased or decreased, and how the energy is exchanged with the external environment. 
This paper has the aim to make a review about the mass evolution of Schwarzschild black holes with different initial masses and
external conditions as the empty space, the cosmic microwave background with constant temperature, and with temperature varying 
in accordance with the eras of the universe. As a result, we have the complete evaporation of the black holes in most cases, 
although their masses can increase in some cases, and even diverge for specific conditions.
