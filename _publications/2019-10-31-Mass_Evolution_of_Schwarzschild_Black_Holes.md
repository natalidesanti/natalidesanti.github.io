Paper highlights:
- Explores how black holes lose or gain mass due to Hawking radiation depending on their environment.
- Examines black hole evolution in empty space and in a universe filled with cosmic microwave background radiation.
-	Shows that while most black holes eventually evaporate, some can grow or even diverge in mass under special conditions.
