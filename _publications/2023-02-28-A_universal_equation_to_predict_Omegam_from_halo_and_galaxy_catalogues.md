Paper highlights:
- Discovers analytic equations that infer Ωm directly from the phase-space information of halo and galaxy catalogs.
- Combines graph neural networks with symbolic regression to achieve ~6% accuracy on Ωm across thousands of N-body and hydrodynamical simulations run with many different codes.
- Demonstrates robustness to astrophysics and subgrid physics, suggesting a fundamental, galaxy-formation–independent physical relation.
