Paper highlights:
- Uses machine learning to predict galaxy baryonic properties from dark matter halo properties in the IllustrisTNG300 simulation.
- Combines multiple algorithms (tree-based methods, kNN, neural networks) and applies SMOGN data augmentation to address imbalanced datasets, improving predicted distributions and scatter.
- Achieves high accuracy for stellar mass and reasonable performance for other properties, reproducing galaxy power spectra for different galaxy populations.
