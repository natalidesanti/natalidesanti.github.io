Paper highlights:
- __Galaxy bias can be predicted per galaxy:__ using data from IllustrisTNG300, we show that the individual linear bias parameter $b_i$ can be modeled directly from halo and environmental properties, moving beyond population-averaged bias.
- __Environment is the dominant driver:__ local overdensity (especially $\delta_8$) is the most informative feature, followed by distance to cosmic-web structures and halo formation time. Bias is primarily an environmental quantity.
- __Probabilistic ML is essential:__ normalizing flows outperform deterministic models because they capture the intrinsic stochasticity of the matter-halo-galaxy connection, recovering not just the mean bias, but its full distribution.
