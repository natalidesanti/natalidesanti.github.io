This post is dedicated to the **Schwarzschild solution** of _Einstein's equations_. Here I will follows a simple way to deduce it and show why this solution arises to what we call as the basic kind of black hole: the **Schwarzschild Black Holes**.

This post is related with the first steps of my Masters' degree, in _Black Hole Thermodynamics_, that I have worked from 2016 to 2018, with supervision of Professor [Raphael Santarelli](http://lattes.cnpq.br/3591899759824320).

The Einstein's Equations
--------------------------

The core from General Relativity is attributed for Einstein, due to his field equations, from 1915. Those equations related the curvature of the spacetime, represented by the Einstein tensor $G_{\mu \nu}$, with the matter and energy, given by the stress tensor $T^{\mu \nu}$ [1]. Then, we can write
\begin{equation}
 G_{\mu \nu} \equiv R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} = - \frac{8 \pi G}{c^4} T_{\mu \nu} ,
\end{equation}
where $R_{\mu \nu}$ is the Ricci tensor, $R$ is its trace, $g_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric tensor, $G$ is the gravitational constant and $c$ is the speed of light. It is usual to define $G = c = 1$ and recover the Physical units at the end of the computations, and I will do this here as well.

The general idea is that, those equations are extremelly non-linear, which makes those solutions hard to find. However, once we use symmetry, the solutions are more staightful to find. An that was what was made by **Schwarzschild**, in 1916. This solution consists in a spacetime to represent a spherical symmetry, static and asymptotically flat for a gravitational empty field around a spherical massive object [2].

Pursuing the solution
--------------------------

First we need to choose some coordinates to work with. Because we want to work with spherical symmetry, let's use the spherical coordinates and time as
\begin{equation}
 (t, r, \theta, \phi) .
\end{equation}
Using the tensor notation, we can postulate the _line element_ as
\begin{equation}
 ds^2 \equiv g_{\mu \nu} dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu} = A(r) dt^2 - B(r) dr^2 - 
 r^2 [d\theta^2 + \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2] ,
\end{equation}
where I have used _Einstein summation convention_ (a notational convention that implies summation over the indexed terms in the formula) and the functions $A (r)$ and $B (r)$ need to be determined.

From this equation we can see that we are following the assumptions that the solution proposes, i.e.:
 * As $g_{\mu \nu}$ is not time dependent, the solution is static;
 * Keeping $t$ and $r$ as constant quantities, the line element reflects spherical symmetry;
 * We need to find the functions $A (r)$ and $B (r)$ solving the Einstein's equations for the empty space, in other words, considering $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$;
 * Because the spacetime is asymptotically plane ($g_{\mu \nu}$ $\sim$ $\eta_{\mu \nu} =$ Diag$[1, -1, -1, -1]$), we follow the countour conditions $A(r \rightarrow \infty) = 1$ and $B(r\rightarrow \infty) = 1$.
 
Then, using the defictions for the _Ricci tensor_
\begin{equation}
 R_{\mu \nu} \equiv \partial_{\nu} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu \sigma} - 
 \partial_{\sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\mu \nu}
 + \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu \sigma} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\rho \nu} - 
 \Gamma^{\rho}_{\mu \nu} \Gamma^{\sigma}_{\rho \sigma} ,
\end{equation}
and for the _Christoffel symbol_
\begin{equation}
 \Gamma^{a}_{b c} \equiv \frac{g^{a d}}{2} \left( \partial_{b} g_{d c} + 
 \partial_{c} g_{b d} - \partial_{d} g_{b c}\right) ,
\end{equation}
the nonvanishing terms are
\begin{equation}
 \Gamma^{0}_{0 1} = \frac{A'(r)}{2 A (r)}, \Gamma^{1}_{0 0} = \frac{A'(r)}{2 B(r)},  \Gamma^{1}_{1 1} = \frac{B'(r)}{2 B(r)}, 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
 \Gamma^{1}_{2 2} = - \frac{r}{B (r)} , \Gamma^{1}_{3 3} = - \frac{r \sin^{2} \theta}{B(r)}, \Gamma^{2}_{1 2} = \frac{1}{r}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
 \Gamma^{2}_{3 3} = - \sin \theta \cos \theta, \Gamma^{3}_{1 3} = \frac{1}{r} , \Gamma^{3}_{2 3} = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \theta} .
\end{equation}

Computing now $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, we got
\begin{equation}
 R_{0 0} = - \frac{A''(r)}{2 B(r)} + 
 \frac{A'(r)}{4 B(r)} \left( \frac{A'(r)}{A (r)} +
 \frac{B'(r)}{B(r)}\right) - \frac{A'(r)}{r B(r)} = 0 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 R_{1 1} = \frac{A''(r)}{2 A(r)} - \frac{A'(r)}{4 A(r)} \left( \frac{A'(r)}{A (r)} +  \frac{B'(r)}{B(r)}\right) - \frac{B'(r)}{r B(r)} = 0 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
R_{2 2} = \frac{1}{B(r)} + 
 \frac{r}{2 B(r)} \left( \frac{A'(r)}{A (r)} - 
 \frac{B'(r)}{B (r)} \right) - 1 = 0 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 R_{3 3} = \sin^{2} \theta R_{2 2} = 0
\end{equation}
where $R_{\mu \nu} = 0$, for $\mu \neq \nu$.

Solving this system of equations you can easily figure out that
\begin{equation}
 \frac{A'(r)}{r A(r)} + \frac{B'(r)}{r B (r)} = 0 ,
\end{equation}
and, therefore, obtain the solution
\begin{equation}
 A (r) = \left( 1 + \frac{k}{r}\right) \text{and} 
 B(r) = \left( 1 + \frac{k}{r}\right)^{-1} ,
\end{equation}
where $k$ is an integration constant, that urges to be determined!

If you think in the limit that $r \rightarrow \infty$, we can change the variables in the way that 
\begin{equation}
 (t, r, \theta, \phi) \rightarrow (x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) ,
\end{equation}
modifying the metric as
\begin{equation}
 g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + h_{\mu \nu} \nonumber ,
\end{equation}
\begin{eqnarray}
 [g_{\mu \nu}] = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
  1 + \frac{k}{r} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
  0 & -1 + \frac{k (x^1)^2}{(k + r)r^2} & \frac{k x^1 x^2}{(k + r)r^2} & \frac{k x^1 x^3}{(k + r)r^2} \\
  0 & \frac{k x^2 x^1}{(k + r)r^2} & -1 + \frac{k (x^2)^2}{(k + r)r^2} & \frac{k x^2 x^3}{(k + r)r^2} \\
  0 & \frac{k x^3 x^1}{(k + r)r^2} & \frac{k x^3 x^2}{(k + r)r^2} & -1 + \frac{k (x^3)^2}{(k + r)r^2} \\
 \end{array}\right] ,
\end{eqnarray}
being $r = \sqrt{(x^1)^{2} + (x^2)^{2} + (x^3)^{2}}$ and $h_{\mu \nu}$ small in this limit.

Here comes the key for the problem, because, using this metric we can think in the _geodesic equation_ for a particle of mass $m$ in this spacetime as
\begin{equation}
 m \frac{d^2 r}{dt^2} = - \frac{m}{2} \frac{\partial h_{0 0}}{\partial r}
\end{equation}
which is very similar to the Newtonian equation of motion
\begin{equation}
 m \frac{d^2 {\bf r}}{d t^2} = - m \nabla V = - \frac{M m}{r^2} \hspace{0.1cm} \hat{r} ,
\end{equation}
if we consider $V = - M/r$, being the gravitational potential, $M$ the mass generating this field and $h_{0 0} = k/r$. Thus, 
\begin{equation}
 k = - \frac{2 M G}{c^2} ,
\end{equation}
recovering the Physical units.

Finally, the **Schwarzschild metric** becomes
\begin{equation}
 ds^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{2 M G}{c^2 r}\right) dt^2 - 
 \left( 1 - \frac{2M G}{c^2 r}\right)^{-1} dr^2 -  r^2 [d\theta^2 + sin^2 \theta d\phi^2] ,
\end{equation}

But, what about the black holes???

Well, let's discuss about the points where the _Schwarzschild metric_ diverges. Looking at the radius term we see that, when
\begin{equation}
 r = \frac{2 M G}{c^2} ,
\end{equation} 
the radius term diverges. When we have this value for the radius of the massive object we say that we are at the **Schwarzschild radius** and yeah, here comes the **black holes**. This value represents the _event horizon_ for a black hole, in other words, the maximum distance that an external observer "can see".

### Black hole formation

We can say that black holes are formed due to the gravitational stellar collapse. Because a star is a "tug of war" between the pression (due to the nuclear fusion of its components) and the gravitation force, when the second starts to win, the star starts to collapse, i.e., the nuclear power ends. Then, the star density increases a lot and, when decreasing more than its _Schwarzschild radius_, nothing more can scape: we have formed a **black hole**.

And what about the _Schwarzschild metric_? Well, it is the metric wich is able to describe de exterior of the star, turning to a black hole, when it is collapsing (let's look at _Birkhoff's theorem_, to know more).

### Black hole types

And why the Schwarzschild black hole is the "first kind" of black holes? Because we can say that there are only four solutions for the _Einstein's equations_ describing the ones which are stationary and asimptotically planes (see more looking for the _"no-hair" theorem_):
 * **Schwarzschild black hole:** characterized only by its mass $M$;
 * **Kerr black hole:** characterized by its mass $M$ and angular momentum $L$;
 * **Reissner-Nordstrom black hole:** characterized by its mass $M$ and its charge $Q$;
 * **Kerr-Newman black hole:** characterized by its mass $M$, charge $Q$ and angular momentum $L$.
