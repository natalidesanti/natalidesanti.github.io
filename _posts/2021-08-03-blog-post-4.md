In this post you will see what is the **bizarre Casimir Effect**. I will start telling you about _quantum fluctuations_, 
give you some qualitative definition of it and, then, two quantitative descriptions. As I warned you in the previous post 
([Harmonic Oscillator](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), the Physics/Mathematics behind of this effect are 
the _quantum harmonic oscillators_!
