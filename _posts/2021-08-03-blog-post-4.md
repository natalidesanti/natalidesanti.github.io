In this post you will see what is the **bizarre Casimir Effect**. I will start telling you about _quantum fluctuations_, 
give you some qualitative definition of it and, then, two quantitative descriptions. As I warned you in the previous post 
([Harmonic Oscillator](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), the Physics/Mathematics behind of this effect are 
the _quantum harmonic oscillators_!

What are Quantum Fluctuations? And what heck is the quantum vacuum?
--------------------------

In _Classical Mechanics_ the evolution of a system of particles is given knowing the initial position $x$ and the
momentum $p$ of all particles, as well the forces applied on them. But, this way of "thinking" about the description
changes a lot when we go to _Quantum Mechanics_, due the **Uncertainty Principle** (of Heisenberg). This principle could
be expressed using two equations
\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \gtrsim \hbar/2 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \gtrsim \hbar/2 .
\end{equation}
The first equation says that we cannot determine, with precision and at the same time, the position and momentum of some
particle. The second one implies that a perfect measure of the energy of some system needs an infinite time.

A really interesting consequence of this principle is that we can violate momentously the _conservation energy principle_
if and just if this happens by an interval of time very small, lower than $\hbar/(2 \Delta E)$. Here we have the 
**energy quantum fluctuations**! Then, using the energy-mass relation
\begin{equation}
 E = m c^2
\end{equation}
we can interpret the _quantum fluctuations of energy_, for instance, in the vacuum, as **virtual particles**. Because
those particles live just by an infinitesimal amount of time we cannot detect them. Although, we can "see" the effects
generated by their existence. Due to them, we have the mediation of fundamental interactions (like the strong iteraction
or even the virtual photons, in the electrical force) [1].

Ok, but why the title of this section contains the **quantum vacuum**? To be clear, everything! So, every time that we
think about _vacuum_ we imagine a physical region obtained excluding every kind of matter on it, right? However, the
entity **quantum vacuum** is a vacuum populated by a legion of particles, yeah, the _virtual particles_, that could not
be removed. And, of course, they exists due the quantum fluctuations!

The Casimir effect - Qualitative explanation
--------------------------

The _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ are responsible to generate the **bizarre Casimir effect**. In this phenomenon, there
is the attraction between two metallic plates, that are electrically neutral and with negligible mass.

###### Figure 1: [Artistic representation of Casimir effect](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/44/Casimir_plates.svg/800px-Casimir_plates.svg.png)

More specifically, the _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ generates a difference of pressure between the plates and in its
exterior. More specifically, due to the lower amount of space between the plates, the density of virtual particles there
is lower than in the exterior space. Thus, as we have a huge pressure outside, the plates attracts to each other.

In fact, any medium supporting oscillations can be an **analogous** to the _Casimir effect_. But, a classical analogue to
this effect (that I really love) is the attraction between two metal and electrically neutral plates, in some liquid,
with _sonication machines_. In the video 
[Water Wave Analog of the Casimir Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-GnwnEnLCA), we have the demonstration of it.
The video shows that traveling water waves carry momentum! There is a container of liquid (ethyl alcohol) with a dye 
fluorescent (so, the waves can be seen) and two parallel plates are suspended from clamps attached to a support. The 
container rests on a shaker. The shaker is driven with noise in a band of frequencies from 10 to 20 Hz, and excites 
surface waves. Therefore, the plates attract to each other. Another very interesting reference is given by the 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.3211416).

A really briefly history, Quantum Field Theory and the problem with infinities
----------------------------------------

In 1948 _Hendrik Brugt Gerhard_ Casimir proposed a way to perturb the vacuum and achieve a finite variation of energy $\Delta E$, which was known as **Casimir effect**. To understand this phenomenon, **quantitatively speaking**, you need to understand a little of _Quantum Field Theory_ (QFT), which states that all of the various fundamental fields, such as the _electromagnetic field_ or the _Klein-Gordon field_, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In other words, the field is a function of the time and space. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate _wave equation_ for the particular field in question. At the "most basic level", the field at each point in space is a _simple harmonic oscillator_, and its quantization "places" a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. That is why I started to study harmonic oscillator!!!

So, in order to understand where and why the Casimir effect arises, let's start with the **Klein-Gordon field**, the most basic field in QFT.

### The Klein-Gordon field

The **Klein-Gordon equation** is a relativistic wave equation, related to the _Schrodinger equation_ (yeah, the most
famous equation of the Quantum Mechanics!). This wave equation
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar} \right] \phi (x) = 0
\end{equation}
describes a scalar field of mass $m$ and spin 0. This equation could be obtained from the _Hamiltonian density_
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \pi (x)^2 + |\nabla \phi|^2 + \mu^2 \phi(x)^2 \right],
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 \pi(x) = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{1}{c^2} \dot{\phi}(x)
\end{equation}
is the conjugate momentum to the field $\phi(x,t)$ and $\mu = m c / \hbar$.

The quantum version of this field could be obtained imposing the _commutation relations_
\begin{equation}
         \left[\hat{\phi}({\bf x},t), \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x}',t) \right] = i \hbar c^2  \delta({\bf x} - {\bf x}')
\end{equation}  
\begin{equation}
         \left[\hat{\phi}({\bf x},t), \hat{\phi}({\bf x}',t) \right] = \left[ \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x},t), 
       \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x}',t)\right] = 0.
\end{equation}
To interpret this, we can expand the Klein-Gordon field in
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi} (x) = \hat{\phi}^+ (x) + \hat{\phi}^- (x),
\end{equation}
using
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi}^+ (x) = \sum_k \left( \frac{\hbar c^2}{2V\omega_k}\right)^{1/2} \hat{a}({\bf k}) e^{-ikx}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi}^- (x) = \sum_k \left( \frac{\hbar c^2}{2V \omega_k}\right)^{1/2} \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}) e^{ikx}.
\end{equation}
Here, $V$ is the volume of a cube with side $L$ ($V = L^3$), $\omega_k$ is the angular frequency of oscillation and 
$\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector. Besides, the sum is over all the allowed $\mathbf{k}$s and
\begin{equation}
 k^0 = \frac{1}{c} \omega_k = + \left( \mu^2 + {\bf k}^2 \right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
The, $k$ is the quadrivector of a particle of mass $m = \mu \hbar/c$, momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$ and energy
\begin{equation}
 E = \hbar\omega_k = + \sqrt{m^2c^4 + c^2(\hbar{\bf k})^2}.
\end{equation}
Using the expansion of the Klein-Gordon field and the commutation relation (for its quantization) we can obtain the 
commutation relations between the operator $\hat{a}({\bf k})$ and $\hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k})$, which are
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \hat{a}({\bf k}), \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}') \right]  = \delta_{\bf k, k'}\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left[ \hat{a}({\bf k}), \hat{a}({\bf k}') \right] = \left[ \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}), \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}')\right] = 0 .
\end{equation}
If you remember (or can remember [here](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), it is exactly the _quantum 
harmonic oscillator_ commutation relations of the raise and low operators!

At the same time, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian using these operators as
\begin{equation}
 H = \sum_{k} \hbar \omega_k \left[ a^{\dagger}({\bf k})a({\bf k}) + \frac{1}{2} \right].
\end{equation}
Paying attention on this Hamiltonian you can see that the system is described by a set of decoupled harmonic 
oscillators! Moreover, the state of lower energy, i.e., the **vacuum state** $\langle 0 \rangle$ is
\begin{equation}
 a({\bf k}) \left|0\right> = 0, \hspace{0.6cm}\forall {\bf k},
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, as
\begin{equation}
 \phi^+ (x) \left|0\right> = 0, \hspace{0.6cm} \forall x.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the vacuum has **infinity energy**
\begin{equation}
 E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k}\hbar\omega_k .
\end{equation}
In fact, this summation includes a infinity number of normal modes $k$ and the frequency $\omega_k$ increases with it. 
However, this is a problem _only_ when we wanna look exactly at this term, because, in all physical measures, as we only 
measure difference of energies, it is automatically removed!

In QFT, this kind of infinities arises all the time: not only for the Klein-Gordon field, but, for instance, for the 
electromagnetic field too (because all the fields could be seen as a set of quantum harmonic oscillators!). To 
understand what to do with these quantities, there is something called **renormalization**, a collection of techniques 
to treat infinities. Inside it, there is the **regularization methods**, which is a way to mathematically define the 
divergences, using theory of limits. Here I will tell you two techniques of it:
- Cut-off regularization,
- Dimensional regularization.

And, the reason why I will do this is that, treating the infinity for the vacuum, we are computing a finite value for it 
$\Rightarrow$ deducing the Casimir effect.

Approach 1: Cut-off regularization
-----------------------------------

In the zero-point energy of the electromagnetic field, there is a term of the frequencies $\omega_k$. This term depend 
on the geometry of the volume in which the field is confined. If the _geometrical form changes the frequency of the 
normal modes, the zero-point energy will also change_ [2].

###### Figure 2: [Casimir effect for cut-off regularization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalidesanti/natalidesanti.github.io/master/images/cutoff.png)

Here, we can consider the region contained in a closed metallic box, electrically neutral of length $R$ and basal area 
$A = L^2$. Inside this box we introduce another plate, at some distance from the first one (initially it is at a 
distance $d$ and at the final position it is at a distance $R/\eta$). We are interested in the energy of the system 
depending on the _position_ of one of the plates. And, to compute that energy, subtract the energy of a _final_ ($f$) 
from an initial configuration ($i$):
\begin{equation}
 U (d, R, A) = E_i - E_f = [E (R/\eta) + E (R - R/\eta)] - [E (d) + E (R - d)] .
\end{equation}
To implies in the Casimir Effect we need to move the walls, in the way that the quantization volume becomes infinity. 
Thus, we are computing
\begin{equation}
 U (d, A) = \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} U (d, R, A).
\end{equation}
As every piece of that energy diverges, we need to find a **cut-off**.

This **cut-off** could be made using a **cut-off parameter**, that could be the wavelength $\lambda$. Then, the vacuum 
energy could be written as
\begin{equation}
 E = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sum_{k} \omega_k e^{- \lambda \omega_k/c}.
\end{equation}
In the case of a box, the frequency is
\begin{equation}
 \label{k}
 \omega_{l,m,n} = c\hspace{0.1cm}k_{l,m,n} (d, L, L) = c\hspace{0.1cm}
 \sqrt{\left(\frac{l\pi}{d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{m\pi}{L}\right)^2 + 
 \left(\frac{n\pi}{L}\right)^2} \hspace{0.2cm},
\end{equation}
where $l, m, n \in \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, the energy (just disconsidering a factor of $\hbar c/2$) becomes
\begin{equation}
 E (d, L) = \sum_{l, m, n = 0}^{\infty} k_{l, m, n} (d, L, L) 
 \hspace{0.1cm}e^{- \lambda k_{l, m, n} (d, L, L)} \hspace{0.2cm}.
 \label{E0}
\end{equation}
In the limit that we want ($L \gg d$), the energy becomes
\begin{equation}
 E (d, L) = \frac{A \pi^2}{2d} \frac{d^2}{d\alpha^2} \left[
 \sum^{\infty}_{n=0} \frac{B_n}{n!} \left(\frac{\alpha}{d}\right)^{n-2}\right] 
 \hspace{0.2cm},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = \pi \lambda$ and the coefficients $B_n$ are the _Bernoulli's numbers_. In the limit where 
$\alpha \rightarrow 0$, we could keep just the firsts terms of this expression, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
 E (d, L) = \frac{A \pi^2}{2} \frac{d^2}{d\alpha^2} \left[\frac{d}{\alpha^2} - 
 \frac{1}{2\alpha} + \frac{1}{12d} - \frac{\alpha^2}{720d^3} + O(\alpha^4) 
 \right] \hspace{0.2cm}.
\end{equation}

In the case of the difference of energy $U (d, A)$, the terms proportionals to $\alpha^{- 2}$ and $\alpha^{- 1}$ cancel 
out. Moreover, the terms of order $\alpha^0$ are zero because the derivative operation. In this way, we got
\begin{equation}
 U (d, A) = -\frac{A \pi^2 \hbar c}{720} \lim_{R \rightarrow \infty} 
 \lim_{\alpha \rightarrow 0} \left\{ \left[\frac{1}{d^3} + \frac{1}{(R-d)^3} 
 - \frac{1}{(R/\eta)^3} - \frac{1}{(R - R/\eta)^3}\right] \right\}
\end{equation}
and finally
\begin{equation}
 \label{UUU}
 U(d,A) = -\frac{A \pi^2}{720} \, \frac{\hbar c}{d^3} \hspace{0.2cm}.
\end{equation}

If we compute the force between the plates, we obtain
\begin{equation}
 \label{F}
 F = -\frac{\partial}{\partial d} \hspace{0.1cm} U(d,A) = - \frac{A \pi^2}{240} 
 \, \frac{\hbar c}{d^4} \hspace{0.2cm},
\end{equation}
which is an **attractive force**.

Approach 2: Dimensional regularization
-------------------------------

In the case of the **dimensional regularization** we can consider two metal, neutral metallic plates in the vacuum, 
separated by a distance $d$ [3].

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalidesanti/natalidesanti.github.io/master/images/dimensional.png)
###### Figure 3: [Casimir effect for dimensional regularization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natalidesanti/natalidesanti.github.io/master/images/dimensional.png)


This geometry allows the frequency $\omega_k$ be written as
 \begin{equation}
  \omega_{k, n} = c\hspace{0.1cm}\sqrt{k^2 + \left(\frac{n\pi}{d}\right)^2}
  \hspace{0.2cm},
 \end{equation}
where $n$ represents the longitudinal mode of oscillation and $k$ represents the transversal wave vector. The energy is 
given by unit of area (because we are in one dimension, at least until now) by
 \begin{equation}
  \label{RN}
  E = \frac{\hbar c}{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} 
  \frac{d^2k}{(2\pi)^2} \sqrt{k^2 + \left(\frac{n\pi}{d}\right)^2} 
  \hspace{0.2cm}.
 \end{equation}
To apply the _dimensional regularization_ we can fix the transversal dimension equal to $D$ and, we need to chance the 
dimension of the square root for $s$, i.e., we write
 \begin{equation}
  \label{RN1}
  E = \frac{\hbar c}{2} \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty} \int \frac{d^D k}{(2 \pi)^D}
  \left[ k^2 + \left(\frac{n \pi}{d}\right)^2 \right]^{- s}\hspace{0.2cm}.
 \end{equation}
Clearly, at the end of this computations, we need to take the limit where $D \rightarrow 2$ and $s \rightarrow - 1/2$. 
Using properties from the special functions _Gamma_ $\Gamma (z)$ and _Riemmann's zeta_ $\zeta(z)$, like
 \begin{equation}
  \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \frac{d^D k}{(2 \pi)^D} \left[ k^2 + 
  \left(\frac{n \pi}{d}\right)^2 \right]^{- s} = \frac{1}{\Gamma (s)} 
  \int^{\infty}_{- \infty} \frac{d^D k}{(2 \pi)^D} \int^{\infty}_{0} 
  d\tau \hspace{0.2cm} \tau^{s - 1} \hspace{0.2cm}
  e^{- \tau \left[ k^2 + (n\pi/d)^2 \right]}\hspace{0.2cm},
 \end{equation}
which is valid for $s > 0$ but not for $s = - 1/2$. So, why we can use it? Because we can write the energy as
 \begin{equation}
  \label{EEE}
  E = \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma (s)}\hspace{0.2cm}
  \frac{\Gamma (s - D/2)}{2^{D + 1} \pi^{2s - D/2}} \hspace{0.2cm}
  d^{2s - D} \hspace{0.2cm}\zeta (2s - D) \hspace{0.2cm}.
 \end{equation}
Of course this expression is undetermined for $2s - D \leq 1$, but, using the _reflection property_ 
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma \left(\frac{z}{2}\right)\hspace{0.2cm}\zeta(z)\hspace{0.2cm}\pi^{- z/2} = 
  \Gamma \left(\frac{1 - z}{2}\right)\hspace{0.2cm}\zeta(1 - z)
  \hspace{0.2cm}\pi^{(z-1)/2}
 \end{equation}
with $z = 2s - D$, we obtain
 \begin{equation}
  \label{Efinal}
  E = \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma(s)}\hspace{0.2cm}\frac{\pi^{-(D + 1)/2}}{2^{D + 1}}
  \hspace{0.2cm}d^{2s - D}\hspace{0.2cm}\Gamma 
  \left( \frac{1 - 2s + D}{2} \right)\hspace{0.2cm}\zeta \left(1 - 2s + D\right)
  \hspace{0.2cm}.
 \end{equation}
The above result is well behaved when we take the physical limits $s \rightarrow - 1/2$ and $D \rightarrow 2$. Then, 
using that $\Gamma(-1/2) = - 2 \sqrt{\pi}$ and $\Gamma(2) = 1$ e $\zeta(4) = \pi^4/90$, the energy $U(d)$, between the 
two plates at a distance $d$ from each other, is given by
 \begin{equation}
  U (d) = 2 \hspace{0.2cm}\lim_{s \rightarrow -1/2} \hspace{0.2cm}
  \lim_{D \rightarrow 2} E = 2 \hspace{0.2cm}
  \frac{\hbar c}{\Gamma(-1/2)} \hspace{0.2cm}\frac{\pi^{- 3/2}}{2^3 d^3} 
  \hspace{0.2cm}\Gamma(2) \hspace{0.2cm}\zeta(4)
  = - \hspace{0.2cm}\frac{\pi^2}{720} \hspace{0.2cm}\frac{\hbar c}{d^3}
  \hspace{0.2cm}.
 \end{equation}
Remember that this results is multiplied by $2$ because the photons have two polarization states.

Therefore, the force (per unit of area) is
 \begin{equation}
  \label{F2}
  F(d) = - \frac{\partial}{\partial d} U(d) = - \frac{\pi^2}{240} 
  \frac{\hbar c}{d^4}\hspace{0.2cm},
 \end{equation}
which is in accordance with the result from the approach 1. This method could be seen as "pure mathematical magic", but 
it is "more robust", when compared with the previous one, in the sense that it method does not need any subtraction of 
energy on its deduction.

Conclusions
-------------------------------

Both approaches makes clear that the force between two metallic and uncharged plates, in other words, the 
_Casimir effect_, depends of $\hbar$ and $c$, showing the pure quantum nature behind this effect.
