In this post you will see what is the **bizarre Casimir Effect**. I will start telling you about _quantum fluctuations_, 
give you some qualitative definition of it and, then, two quantitative descriptions. As I warned you in the previous post 
([Harmonic Oscillator](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), the Physics/Mathematics behind of this effect are 
the _quantum harmonic oscillators_!

What are Quantum Fluctuations? And what heck is the quantum vacuum?
--------------------------

In _Classical Mechanics_ the evolution of a system of particles is given knowing the initial position $x$ and the
momentum $p$ of all particles, as well the forces applied on them. But, this way of "thinking" about the description
changes a lot when we go to _Quantum Mechanics_, due the **Uncertainty Principle** (of Heisenberg). This principle could
be expressed using two equations
\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \gtrsim \hbar/2 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \gtrsim \hbar/2 .
\end{equation}
The first equation says that we cannot determine, with precision and at the same time, the position and momentum of some
particle. The second one implies that a perfect measure of the energy of some system needs an infinite time.

A really interesting consequence of this principle is that we can violate momentously the _conservation energy principle_
if and just if this happens by an interval of time very small, lower than $\hbar/(2 \Delta E)$. Here we have the 
**energy quantum fluctuations**! Then, using the energy-mass relation
\begin{equation}
 E = m c^2
\end{equation}
we can interpret the _quantum fluctuations of energy_, for instance, in the vacuum, as **virtual particles**. Because
those particles live just by an infinitesimal amount of time we cannot detect them. Although, we can "see" the effects
generated by their existence. Due to them, we have the mediation of fundamental interactions (like the strong iteraction
or even the virtual photons, in the electrical force) [1].

Ok, but why the title of this section contains the **quantum vacuum**? To be clear, everything! So, every time that we
think about _vacuum_ we imagine a physical region obtained excluding every kind of matter on it, right? However, the
entity **quantum vacuum** is a vacuum populated by a legion of particles, yeah, the _virtual particles_, that could not
be removed. And, of course, they exists due the quantum fluctuations!

The Casimir effect - Qualitative explanation
--------------------------

The _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ are responsible to generate the **bizarre Casimir effect**. In this phenomenon, there
is the attraction between two metallic plates, that are electrically neutral and with negligible mass.

More specifically, the _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ generates a difference of pressure between the plates and in its
exterior. More specifically, due to the lower amount of space between the plates, the density of virtual particles there
is lower than in the exterior space. Thus, as we have a huge pressure outside, the plates attracts to each other.

In fact, any medium supporting oscillations can be an **analogous** to the _Casimir effect_. But, a classical analogue to
this effect (that I really love) is the attraction between two metal and electrically neutral plates, in some liquid,
with _sonication machines_. In the video 
[Water Wave Analog of the Casimir Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-GnwnEnLCA), we have the demonstration of it.
The video shows that traveling water waves carry momentum! There is a container of liquid (ethyl alcohol) with a dye 
fluorescent (so, the waves can be seen) and two parallel plates are suspended from clamps attached to a support. The 
container rests on a shaker. The shaker is driven with noise in a band of frequencies from 10 to 20 Hz, and excites 
surface waves. Therefore, the plates attract to each other. Another very interesting reference is given by the 
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.3211416).

A really briefly history, Quantum Field Theory and the problem with infinities
----------------------------------------

In 1948 _Hendrik Brugt Gerhard_ Casimir proposed a way to perturb the vacuum and achieve a finite variation of energy $\Delta E$, which was known as **Casimir effect**. To understand this phenomenon, **quantitatively speaking**, you need to understand a little of _Quantum Field Theory_ (QFT), which states that all of the various fundamental fields, such as the _electromagnetic field_ or the _Klein-Gordon field_, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In other words, the field is a function of the time and space. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate _wave equation_ for the particular field in question. At the "most basic level", the field at each point in space is a _simple harmonic oscillator_, and its quantization "places" a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. That is why I started to study harmonic oscillator!!!

So, in order to understand where and why the Casimir effect arises, let's start with the **Klein-Gordon field**, the most basic field in QFT.
