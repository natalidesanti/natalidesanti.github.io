In this post you will see what is the **bizarre Casimir Effect**. I will start telling you about _quantum fluctuations_, 
give you some qualitative definition of it and, then, two quantitative descriptions. As I warned you in the previous post 
([Harmonic Oscillator](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), the Physics/Mathematics behind of this effect are 
the _quantum harmonic oscillators_!

What are Quantum Fluctuations? And what heck is the quantum vacuum?
--------------------------

In _Classical Mechanis_ the evolution of a system of particles is given knowing the initial position $x$ and the momentum 
$p$ of all particles, as well the forces applied on them. But, this way of "thinking" about the description changes a lot 
when we go to _Quantum Mechanics_, due the **Uncertainty Principle** (of Heisenberg). This principle could be expressed 
using two equations
\begin{equation}
 \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \gtrsim \hbar/2 ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
 \Delta E \cdot \Delta t \gtrsim \hbar/2 .
\end{equation}
The first equation says that we cannot determine, with precision and at the same time, the position and momentum of some 
particle. The second one implies that a perfect measure of the energy of some system needs an infinite time.

A really interesting consequence of this principle is that we can violate momentaneally the _conservation energy principle_
if and just if this happens by an interval of time very small, lower than $\hbar/(2 \Delta E)$. Here we have the 
**energy quantum fluctuations**! Then, using the energy-mass relation
\begin{equation}
 E = m c^2
\end{equation}
we can interpret the _quantum fluctuations of energy_, for instance, in the vacuum, as **virtual particles**. Because 
those particles live just by an infinitesimal ammount of time we cannot detect them. Although, we can "see" the effects 
generated by their existence. Due to them, we have the mediation of fundamental interactions (like the strong iteraction 
or even the virtual photons, in the eletrical force) [1].

Ok, but why the title of this section contains the **quantum vacuum**? To be clear, all! So, everytime that we think about
_vacuum_ we imagine a physical region obtained excluding every kind of matter on it, right? However, the entity 
**quantum vacuum** is a vacuum populated by a legion of particles, yeah, the _virtual particles_, that could not be 
removed. And, of course, they exists due the quantum fluctuations!

The Casimir effect - Qualitative explanation
--------------------------

The _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ are responsible to generate the **bizarre Casimir effect**. In this phenomenum, there 
is the attaction between two metallic plates, that are eletrically neutral and with negligible mass.

More specifically, the _vacuum quantum fluctuations_ generates a difference of pressure between the plates and in its 
exterior. More specifically, due to the lower ammount of space between the plates, the density of virtual particles there 
is lower than in the exterior space. Thus, as we have a huge pressure outside, the plates attracts to each other.

In fact, any medium supporting oscillations can be an **analogous** to the _Casimir effect_. But, a classical analogue to 
this effect (that I really love) is the attraction between two metal and eletrically neutral plates, in some liquid, with 
_sonication machines_. In the video [Water Wave Analog of the Casimir Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-GnwnEnLCA),
we have the demonstration of it. The video shows that traveling water waves carry momentum! There is a container of liquid 
(ethyl alcohol) with a dye flourescein (so, the waves can be seen) and two parallel plates are suspended from clamps attached 
to a support. The container rests on a shaker. The shaker is driven with noise in a band of frequencies from 10 to 20 Hz, 
and excites surface waves. Therefore, the plates attract to each other. Another very interesting reference is given by the
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1119/1.3211416).

A really briefy history, Quantum Field Theory and the problem with infinities
----------------------------

In 1948 _Hendrik Brugt Gerhard_ Casimir proposed a way to perturb the vacuum and achieve a finite variation of energy 
$\Delta E$, which was known as **Casimir effect**. To understand this **quantitetively speaking** you need to understand 
a little of _Quantum Field Theory_ (QFT), which states that all of the various fundamental fields, such as the 
_electromagnetic field_ or the _Klein-Gordon field_, must be quantized at each and every point in space. In other words, 
the field is a function of the time and space. Vibrations in this field propagate and are governed by the appropriate
_wave equation_ for the particular field in question. At the "most basic level", the field at each point in space is a 
_simple harmonic oscillator_, and its quantization "places" a quantum harmonic oscillator at each point. That is why I 
started to study harmonic oscillator!!!

So, in order to understand where and why the Casimir effect arises, let's start with the **Klein-Gordon field**, the most 
basic field in QFT.

### The Klein-Gordon field

The **Klein-Gordon equation** is a relativistic wave equation, related to the _Schrodinger equation_ (yeah, the most 
famous equation of the Quantum Mechanics!). This wave equation
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 + \frac{m^2 c^2}{\hbar} \right] \phi (x) = 0
\end{equation}
describes a scalar field of mass $m$ and spin 0. This equation could be obtained from the _Hamiltonian density_
\begin{equation}
 \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \pi (x)^2 + |\nabla \phi|^2 + \mu^2 \phi(x)^2 \right],
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
 \pi(x) = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{\phi}} = \frac{1}{c^2} \dot{\phi}(x)
\end{equation}
is the conjugate momentum to the field $\phi(x,t)$ and $\mu = m c / \hbar$.

The quantum version of this field could be obtained imposing the _commutation relations_
\begin{equation}
         \left[\hat{\phi}({\bf x},t), \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x}',t) \right] = i \hbar c^2  \delta({\bf x} - {\bf x}')
\end{equation}  
\begin{equation}
         \left[\hat{\phi}({\bf x},t), \hat{\phi}({\bf x}',t) \right] = \left[ \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x},t), 
       \dot{\hat{\phi}}({\bf x}',t)\right] = 0.
\end{equation}
To interpret this, we can expand the Klein-Gordon field in
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi} (x) = \hat{\phi}^+ (x) + \hat{\phi}^- (x),
\end{equation}
using
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi}^+ (x) = \sum_k \left( \frac{\hbar c^2}{2V\omega_k}\right)^{1/2} \hat{a}({\bf k}) e^{-ikx}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\phi}^- (x) = \sum_k \left( \frac{\hbar c^2}{2V\omega_k}\right)^{1/2} \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}) e^{ikx}.
\end{equation}
Here, $V$ is the volume of a cube with side $L$ ($V = L^3$), $\omega_k$ is the angular frenquency of oscillation and 
$\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector. Besides, the sum is over all the allowed $\mathbf{k}$s and
\begin{equation}
 k^0 = \frac{1}{c} \omega_k = + \left( \mu^2 + {\bf k}^2 \right)^{1/2}.
\end{equation}
The, $k$ is the quadrivector of a particle of mass $m = \mu \hbar/c$, momentum $\hbar \mathbf{k}$ and energy
\begin{equation}
 E = \hbar\omega_k = + \sqrt{m^2c^4 + c^2(\hbar{\bf k})^2}.
\end{equation}
Using the expansion of the Klein-Gordon field and the commutation relation (for its quantisation) we can obtain the 
commutation relations between the operator $\hat{a}({\bf k})$ and $\hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k})$, which are
\begin{equation}
 \left[ \hat{a}({\bf k}), \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}') \right]  = \delta_{{\bf k},{\bf k}'}\\
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left[ \hat{a}({\bf k}), \hat{a}({\bf k}') \right] = \left[ \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}), \hat{a}^{\dagger}({\bf k}')\right] = 0 .
\end{equation}
If you remember (or can remember [here](https://natalidesanti.github.io/blog-post-3/)), it is exactly the 
_quantum harmonic oscillator_ commutation relations of the raise and low operators!

At the same time, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian using these operators as
\begin{equation}
 H = \sum_{k} \hbar \omega_k \left[ a^{\dagger}({\bf k})a({\bf k}) + \frac{1}{2} \right].
\end{equation}
Paying attention on this Hamiltonian you can see that the system is described by a set of decoupled harmonic oscillators! 
Moreover, the state of lower energy, i.e., the **vacuum state** $\langle 0 \rangle$ is
\begin{equation}
 a({\bf k}) \left|0\right> = 0, \hspace{0.6cm}\forall {\bf k},
\end{equation}
or, equivalently, as
\begin{equation}
 \phi^+ (x) \left|0\right> = 0, \hspace{0.6cm} \forall x.
\end{equation}
Therefore, the vacuum has **infinity energy**
\begin{equation}
 E_0 = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k}\hbar\omega_k .
\end{equation}
In fact, this summation includes a infinity number of normal modes $k$ and the frequency $\omega_k$ increases with it. 
However, this is a problem _only_ when we wanna look exactly at this term, because, in all physical measures, as we only 
measure difference of energies, it is automatically removed!

In QFT, this kind of infinities arises all the time: not only for the Klein-Gordon field, but, for instance, for the 
eletromagnetic field too (because all the fields could be seen as a set of quantum harmonic oscillators!). To understand 
what to do with these quantities, there is something called **renormalization**, a collection of techniques to treat 
infinities. Inside it, there is the **regularization methods**, which is a way to mathematically define the divergences, 
using theory of limits. Here I will tell you two techniques of it:
- Cut-off regularization,
- Dimensional regularization.

And, the reason why I will do this is that, treating the infinity for the vacuum, we are computing a finite value for it 
$\Rightarrow$ deducing the Casimir effect.
