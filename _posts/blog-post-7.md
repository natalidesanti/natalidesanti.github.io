# Graph Neural Networks

Have you ever heard about **graphs**? What about **graph neural networks (GNNs)**? 
If you have never paid attention, let's try to remind you that, structures like the
image below are, actually, _graphs_. And they are filling all the internet.

#### [Figure 1: A simple image background, that you can find anyplace in the internet.](https://i0.wp.com/backgroundabstract.com/wp-content/uploads/edd/2022/01/gradient-network-connection-background_23-2148865392-e1656081168680.jpg?fit=626%2C417&ssl=1)

Let's go with me, to learn a bit about this amazing technique, able to tackle problems 
beyond the usual _tabular data_ from the day-to-day to Cosmology!
