Have you ever heard about **graphs**? What about **graph neural networks (GNNs)**? 
If you have never paid attention, let's try to remind you that, structures like the
image below are, actually, _graphs_. And they are filling all the internet.

Let's go with me, to learn a bit about this amazing technique, able to tackle problems 
beyond the usual _tabular data_ from the day-to-day to Cosmology!

Different data sets
--------------------------

Most of the time, we have _tabular data_ and we would like to make predictions given some columns (the _input data_) of that table 
and other columns (the _target data_) of that table, which you would like to make some predictions using the input. 
This is the simplest idea behind "doing" traditional **machine learning**. 
What this kind of data has is that it is what we call a **structured data set**. 
This means that you will always have your _input_ with the same shape, because the object you are trying to use to learn predictions
has always the same number of features.

The problem arises when we have **unstructured data** and this kind of data is everywhere because everything can be translated into
a _graph_. In other words, this means you can have different _input data_ with different "number of objects" (what we will call in
the graph structure as **nodes**). And the beautiful thing here is that these different "pieces of data" have structure by themselves.
You can think about _unstructured data_ as a set of tables, each one with a different number of rows.
This is the kind of data **GNNs** are amazing to deal with!
