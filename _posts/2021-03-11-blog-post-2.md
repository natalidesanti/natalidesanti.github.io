This post refers to my first Scientific Initiation, in materials production (more specifically pellets of BaTi0.9Zr0.1O3), that I have made in 2012. This work was done under advisor of Professor [Antonio Carlos Hernandes](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2019448857205643) and and student co-orientation of the PdD [Thiago Martins Amaral](http://lattes.cnpq.br/4337492660554921).

The motivation behind the work
--------------------------

**Barium titanate** (BaTiO$_{3}$) is a multifunctional material with wide technological application (it is used in capacitors, eletromechanical transducers and even in nonlinear optics) and arouses great scientific interest by being a ferroeletric ceramic and due to its different physical properties (for instante, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity).

Its structure is of the **perovskite type**, where each unit cell is composed of an _octahedron_ formed by oxygen in the centers of the faces, barium atoms at the vertices of the polyhedron and a titanium atom in the center of the octahedron, if it is in the cubic phase.

In addition to the _cubic phase_ for temperatures above $120^{\circ}C$, BaTiO$_3$ has three more phases: between $120^{\circ}C$ and $5^{\circ}C$ there is the _tetragonal phase_, between $0^{\circ}C$ and $-70^{\circ}C$ there is the _orthorhombic phase_ and below $-70^{\circ}C$ the _rhombohedral phase_ [1].

One of the main properties of this material is **ferroelectricity**, which consists of the presence of an electrical polarization that can be reversed by the action of an external electric field. The origin of ferroelectricity is in the _displacement of titanium_ in relation to the center of the oxygen octahedron in the tetragonal, orthorhombic and rhombohedral phases, however, in the cubic phase the displacement of `Ti` does not exist and it is a paraelectric phase.

The ease with which these dipoles can be reoriented gives rise to a very high electrical permittivity ($> 10,000$), making this material an interesting dielectric medium for capacitors. This allows for large capacitance even in very small devices, which is of fundamental importance for the miniaturization of electronic equipment. However, this material has its maximum permittivity during the ferroelectric/paraelectric transition at $120^{\circ} C$ and it would be interesting to extend this maximum permittivity to temperatures closer to the environment. This can be achieved by adding `Zr` instead of `Ti`, as it is known that this substitution decreases the temperature of the phase transition, opening the possibility for the creation of BaTi$_{(1-x)}$Zr$_x$O$_3$ composites with different values of $x$. These composites would have a maximum permittivity around the transition temperatures of each component of the composite [2].

The objective of the work
------
The objective of the work is the production of pellets of BaTi$_{0.9}$Zr$_{0.1}$O$_3$ and characterization of the material obtained in its subsequent use in the manufacture of composites and studies of its electrical properties, aiming at extending the maximum permittivity to regions of temperatures lower than $120^{\circ}C$.

Methodology,  procedures and results
------

### The powder

The production of the material was made from the stoichiometric calculation for $5 g$ of BaTi$_{0.9}$0Zr$_{0.10}$O$_3$, material composed of BaCO$_3$, TiO$_2$ and ZrO$_2$ in which the powder was homogenized in a zirconia ball mill by $24$ hours in isopropyl alcohol. A first heat treatment (_calcination_) was carried out at $1200^{\circ}C$ for $2$ hours and a second grind for $72$ hours, just like the previous one, in order to reduce the size of the particles.

The structural characterization of the material was made by **X-ray diffraction** using the powder method and scanning electron microscopy. To obtain the _particle size distribution_, a visual count was made with the measurement of their respective sizes in the [**ImageJ software**](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) (at that time I didn't realize the importance of this software. To see an interesting explanation of its funtionalities and general importance, I certainly recomment the [Nature's article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00075-2?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=8a84e193f6-briefing-dy-20210304&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-8a84e193f6-43381817)).

#### Results

The diffractogram of the material revealed the formation of the desired phase, i.e., that the resulting material was exactly the compound BaTi$_{0.9}$0Zr$_{0.10}$O$_3$ [3].

Then, the micrographs and the histogram reveal particles with an average size of $170 nm$, different shapes and wide particle distribution (standard deviation of $130 nm$).

### Pastillization and sinterization

The powder was pelletized and sintered, with two constant levels of temperature. Then, sintered ceramic body was obtained and folowed with application of its platinum electrodes.

### Permittivity

The eletric characterization was made using, specifically, the **permittivity**. The _permittivity_ is a measure of the eletric polarizability of a dieletric, and it is represented by $\epsilon$. This quantity was measured according to its answer to temperature.

Expected results were obtained with some deviations due to possible _contamination_ of the samples during milling in a ball mill, and the permittivity was very high (peak in $T \simeq 50^{\circ}C$ instead of $T \simeq 90^{\circ}C$) but with temperatures closer than the ambient for the doping performed.
